## Description

HealthyEats is a personalized health and fitness recommendation system. This is an innovative project developed during the Hack Harvard Hackathon 2023, focused on the "Health and Fitness" track. Leveraging the Terra API for data generation, this project is designed to empower users to make informed decisions about their health and well-being. 

# What problem are we solving?
Picture this: You wake up in the morning, rush to get ready for work, hastily grab a quick breakfast, and then, just like that, you're off to face the world. You're so engrossed in meetings, deadlines, and responsibilities that the state of your body becomes an afterthought. We're all guilty of this at some point. The days blur into weeks, the weeks into months, and before we know it, we've neglected our own well-being, not realizing that our bodies are sending us silent signals that often go unnoticed.
And that's where HealthyEats can be important. It acts as a bridge between your busy life and your health. It provides insights into your body's state and suggests ways to improve it.
